\description{
Configure the ODBC Driver for Virtuoso
}
\details{
This function is called automatically by [`vos_install()`] and thus
does not usually need to be called by the user.  Users can also manually
configure ODBC as outlined in
<https://github.com/r-dbi/odbc#dsn-configuration-files>.
This is merely a convenience function automating that process on most
systems.

ODBC Uses a odbcinst.ini file to point ODBC at the library required
to drive any given database.  This function helps us automatically
locate the driver library on different operating systems and configure
the odbcinst appropriately for each OS.
