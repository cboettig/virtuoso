Description: Virtuoso is a high-performance "universal server," which can act
             as both a relational database (supporting standard SQL queries),
             and an Resource Description Framework (RDF) triplestore, supporting 
             SPARQL queries and semantic reasoning. The virtuoso R package provides
             R users with a DBI-compatible connection to the Virtuoso database. 
             The package also provides helper routines to install, launch, and manage
             a Virtuoso server locally on Mac, Windows and Linux platforms using
             the standard interactive installers from the R command-line.  By 
             automatically handling these setup steps, the package can make Virtuoso
             considerably faster and easier for a most users to deploy in a local
             environment. While this can be used as a normal dplyr backend, Virtuoso 
             excels when used as a RDF triplestore.  Managing the bulk import of triples
             from common serializations with a single intuitive command is another key
             feature of the virtuoso R package.  Bulk import performance can be tens to
             hundreds of times faster than the comparable imports using existing R tools,
             including rdflib and redland packages.
