Dear CRAN,

I'm pleased to submit my re-revisions of virtuoso package to CRAN. I summarize how I have 
addressed the issues you highlighted in my initial submission below.
.
- I have revised the description along the lines requested.
- I affirm that the package only writes to locations that the user specifies.  
- I have now avoided the dontrun tests, using donttest where examples may take longer than 5 seconds,
  while allowing other tests to run where appropriate.
  
My apologies for these issues and thanks for your patience and your service to our community!

Sincerely,

Carl Boettiger
