Dear CRAN,

I'm pleased to submit the virtuoso package for R to CRAN.  This package provides an
interface to the Virtuoso database backend, similar to existing interfaces such as
RMySQL and RPostgreSQL. A few helper functions are included to facilitate the installation
of the Virtuoso server as well.  Notably, in addition to supporting standard SQL queries,
Virtuoso also enables semantic SPARQL queries.  More details are provided in the package
documentation and vignettes.  This package has been peer reviewed through rOpenSci,
<https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/271>.

Sincerely,

Carl Boettiger
